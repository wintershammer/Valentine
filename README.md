# Valentine

An interpreted toy language using ANTLR4 for parser/lexer/AST generation

Currently supports:

- Dynamic typing


- Arithmetic add,sub,mult,div operations


- Print statement


- Variable assignment


- First class functions (with closures) : Functions can be assigned to variables, be returned by other functions and be used as arguments


The value of the last expression is returned as the value of the function (like Lisps)

Check test.vlnt for a sample program
